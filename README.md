# Election_Analysis
Project for analyzing voting results - using Python

**Overview of Election Audit**

Upon review by the Election Commission, the project was expanded to provide more analysis and further reporting. The additional data requested includes a breakdown of individual counties, their voter turnout, and the percentage of votes cast in each county. 

**Election-Audit Results**

During the analysis, the following outcomes were observed:
